#### Heads Up Display
Your heads up display (HUD) displays basic information about your status in the game, including the amount of loot you have, the health of your ship and any enemy ships.

#### Movement
To move, simply hover your cursor where you want to move to. Your ship will automatically sail towards it. To change course, simply move your cursor to a new position. 

#### Firing the cannon
To fire the cannon, simply click where you want to fire. The cannonball will fly towards that location, and deal damage to anything there on impact (including your ship if you aren't careful!).

If you're creative, you can sail "under" a cannonball if the target is further away. 

#### Collecting Loot
To collect loot, just sail over it. You can use your collected loot to upgrade your ships!

#### Collisions
If you bump into the enemy ship, it'll deal damage to both you and the other ship. Enemies will try to avoid colliding with you, but sometimes they can't turn quick enough!

You can ram other ships to deal a lot of damage quickly, but be careful not to sink yourself in the process.
